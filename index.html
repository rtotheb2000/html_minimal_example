<p title="paragraphs explained">
  This is a paragraph in html. A paragraph is a text blog. It is also an
  html element.
  <br>
  A html site is consits of many html elements. Elements can be
  nested (elements can contain elements).
  <br>
  The structure of an element is:
  <br>
  &lt;tagname&gt;content&lt;/tagname&gt;
</p>
<p>This is now another paragraph. Do you see a difference to:</p>
<p>This is a paragraph in html. A paragraph is a text blog.
  <br> <!--<br> stands for break-->
  This is now another paragraph. Do you see the difference?
  <br>
  (Well it is not another paragraph)
</p>
<p>Note that a paragraph is a part of clearly seperated
  from other parts of your page.</p>
<p>
  This is how you implement a link
  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>
</p>
<p>This is how you implement a picture<br>
  <!--src stands for source, alt stands for the alternative displayed substitue
  -->
  <img src="some_fower.jpg" alt="__loading this picture failed__"
  style="width:300px;height:253px">
  <br>
  <img src="some_flower.jpg" alt="__loading this picture failed__"
  style="width:300px;height:253px">
</p>
<p>This is how you display something in <strong>BOLD</strong></p>
<p>Now lets put in a horizontal line to seperate upcoming text...</p>
<hr>
<p>
  If you want to preserve the format of youre text, then use:
</p>
<pre style="color:red">
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
